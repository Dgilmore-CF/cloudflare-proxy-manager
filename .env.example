# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# DO NOT commit the .env file to version control

# Format: CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_ACCOUNTNAME=your_api_token_here
# Format: CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID_ACCOUNTNAME=your_account_id_here (optional but recommended)

# Production Account
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_PRODUCTION=your_cloudflare_api_token_here
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID_PRODUCTION=your_cloudflare_account_id_here

# Staging Account (add more accounts as needed)
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_STAGING=your_cloudflare_api_token_here
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID_STAGING=your_cloudflare_account_id_here

# Additional accounts can be added following the same pattern
# CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_DEVELOPMENT=your_cloudflare_api_token_here
# CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID_DEVELOPMENT=your_cloudflare_account_id_here

# Notes:
# - The ACCOUNTNAME part (e.g., PRODUCTION, STAGING) can be any descriptive name
# - Account IDs are 32-character hexadecimal strings
# - Including account IDs is highly recommended to ensure operations are scoped to the correct account
# - Without an account ID, the script will operate on all zones accessible by the token
# 
# To find your Account ID:
# 1. Log in to Cloudflare Dashboard
# 2. Select any website
# 3. Look in the right sidebar under "API" or "Account ID"
